# DPMMRecommendation

In Phase 1, we use a non-parametric Bayesian method, DPMM to classify a large number of cloud services into an optimal number of clusters. 
 
In Phase 2, we recommend a personalized PageRank algorithm to obtain more related services for recommendation among the massive cloud service products in the same cluster.

The code of DPMM is from https://github.com/junyachen/GSDPMM.

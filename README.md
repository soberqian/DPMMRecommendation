# DPMMRecommendation

Jiang Y, Ji C, Qian Y, et al. Mining Product Relationships for Recommendation Based on Cloud Service Data[C]//International Conference on Business Process Management. Springer, Cham, 2018: 374-386.


In Phase 1, we use a non-parametric Bayesian method, DPMM to classify a large number of cloud services into an optimal number of clusters. 
 
In Phase 2, we recommend a personalized PageRank algorithm to obtain more related services for recommendation among the massive cloud service products in the same cluster.

The code of DPMM is from https://github.com/junyachen/GSDPMM.
